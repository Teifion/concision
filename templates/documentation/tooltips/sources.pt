<p>
    Sources define the source of the data for your query.
</p>

<!-- <p>
    <strong>Single</strong><br />
    A single source is designed when you are after a single distinct identifier. For example; the stats for an individual agent.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Aggregate</strong> <em>(Not implemented yet)</em><br />
    Aggregate queries are designed for grouping several identifiers together and combining their results. For example; the stats for all the agents from a team, viewed as a team average.
