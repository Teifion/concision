Grouping allows you to combine the results of several values into one, e.g. the average amount of sales for a group of agents in a team.
<br /><br />

For each column you must either make it a grouped column or select an aggregate function. Any column selected as a grouping will be included in the results, anything with an aggregate function will have all the grouped values combined using the selected function.

Sadly grouping is quite a tough one so I'm trying to work out the best way to present the options to end-users. This section is very liable to change so if you have an opinion on the matter please do share it with me.
