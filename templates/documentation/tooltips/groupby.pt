Grouping allows you to combine the results of several values into one, e.g. the average amount of sales for a group of agents in a team.
<br /><br />

For each column you must either make it a grouped column or select an aggregate function. Any column selected as a grouping will be included in the results, anything with an aggregate function will have all the grouped values combined using the selected function.
