Queries produce tabular data based on information we know about them. They can take the following forms:

    Tell me X about Y over Z
    Tell me VPH about RENNAK over the_date
    Tell me average(APV) about team(LODWIGY) over the_date
    Tell me average(APV) about location(LODWIGY) over the_date

You can then add filters onto the core question.

Queries can be viewed in tabular form and depending on the fields requested, graphs.
